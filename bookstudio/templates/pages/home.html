    <h3>Bookstudio- To Quench the Bibliophile's Thirst</h3>
	<p>
		For bibliophiles, a book is their universe from where they withdraw inspiration, motivation, empathise or become one with the characters of the story and experience the rare sort of an euphoria that even materialistic things cannot bring. Like good, old and loyal friends, books come to rescue each time you are put into trouble to offer the gems of wisdom locked in words. They are are also like time-machine that takes us to meet the legends of the past and their captivating history. Maybe that's why, there's no other better mentor than books; no bigger inspiration than books. Now, with online books store, buying books have become really easy with multitude of genres present at one place.</p>
		<p> In India, there are many people who are fond of reading books. However, not many of them are regular in reading books because the new books are costly.Inspite of the presence of some big players in the Indian Online book selling market, there is no one big name which deals in selling and buying old books of a varied genre. Academic books is one section of the market which has not been properly explored by any 1 company, and is still governed by small shops in the vicinity of schools and colleges.Presently, people have limited option with some very rare old book stores within a city where they live</p>
		<p> People are comfortable with reading old books (the ones already read by someone else). Our idea revolves around providing all such people who would like to read their favorite titles in 2nd hand or old used books, an online portal where they can order books.Our platform will also provide an opportunity to people who normally buy new books but would like to sell them after they have read them.Along with maintaining an inventory of all these 2nd hand books, we would also offer an unique feature of matching customers with book-stores near their homes, who have that title.We also plan to create a library of these second-hand books which can be borrowed and then returned after a specified period of time for a specified sum</p>
		<p> We would connect with the major book sellers in all the major cities of India and form a network of book sellers. Our value proposition will be that they will get more customers, a national presence and a commission on every book they deliver to a customer near them.The customers will make their order as well as payment on our website. The ‘price’ listed on our website will be equal to ‘our price’ plus the commission that we are offering to the shopkeepers (which will be in the bracket of 1-3 %). As such, the shopkeeper wouldn’t have to do anything out of ordinary and he does get more orders for books and hence more commission.We will keep an inventory of books, buyed : in bulk from such second-hand book vendors who wouldn’t want to become a part of our network from people registering on our website (by paying them cash or giving them books in return)from major traditional book vendors like Daryaganj market (carefully selected) by conducting online drives, on Social Media, to give old books in return for cash (we can get very good variety at very low price, through this medium)
